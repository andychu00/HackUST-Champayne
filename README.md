This is just a simulation of how our Champayne payment gateway would work in practice. We used anvil to build a sample online store and our sample champayne user website. Before heading to the Champayne website, you should access the online shop and purchase some items first. In the sample online store, simply choose and add items to the shopping cart, and after choosing our payment method in the checkout page, you will be prompted to create a Champayne account. Then to view the transaction status, go to our Champayne user website, and use the same Champayne account you just created to log in, then all transaction history will be shown in the “my transactions” section, where users can then confirm receipt or request for a refund. The source code provided is the python code we used to build our websites in Anvil Editor, it can not generate the html website directly. Therefore, to access our sample website, please use the following link.
